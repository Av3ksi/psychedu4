        "missionParagraph1": "The traditional university system is often characterized by high costs, rigid structures, and inefficient learning cycles that culminate in annual, stressful exam periods. Important knowledge for later professional practice is often lost in the process.",
        "missionParagraph2": "Psychedu was born out of the conviction that there must be a better way. Our mission is to create a practice-oriented, flexible, and meaningful alternative that provides you with the essentials of a psychology degree in a compact and accessible manner.",
        "historyTitle": "The Story Behind Psychedu",
        "historyParagraph": "Psychedu is the result of a one-year project initiated by a single person from Switzerland. As a student of psychology and economics, our founder experienced the frustrations of the classic system firsthand. Driven by the desire to make learning more efficient, relevant, and inspiring, the vision for this platform emerged: a place where education not only serves to obtain a degree but creates real, applicable value for your future.",
        "philosophyTitle": "Our Philosophy",
        "philosophyPoint1": "<strong>Accessible:</strong> We believe that high-quality education should not fail due to excessive prices.",
        "philosophyPoint2": "<strong>Efficient:</strong> We focus on what really matters â€“ the entire knowledge of a bachelor's degree, presented compactly and understandably.",
        "philosophyPoint3": "<strong>Practice-Oriented:</strong> We combine theory with application to optimally prepare you for your professional future."
